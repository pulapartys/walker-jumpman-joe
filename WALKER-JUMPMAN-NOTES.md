## 1. What it is (in one paragraph)

A tiny 2D platformer called **"First Steps"**, built in **Godot 4.7.2** using
**typed GDScript**. You control a little runner: move left/right, do one
fixed-height jump, cross two gaps, avoid a spike, and reach the flag. Dying
triggers an instant auto-respawn. There are no lives and no score. That is the
entire playable game today.

- Engine: **Godot 4.7.2.stable** (Compatibility / OpenGL renderer)
- Language: **typed GDScript**
- Logical resolution: **640 × 360** (window opens at 1280 × 720)
- Main scene: `godot/game/main.tscn`
- Run it: open `godot/project.godot` in Godot, press **▶** (top-right)
- Controls: **A/D or arrows** move · **Space** jump · **R** retry · **Esc/P** pause · **Enter** start/confirm

## 2. ⚠️ THE most important thing: docs describe a bigger game than the code builds

This is the #1 source of confusion. There are effectively **two "games"** in
this repo:

| | The **design docs** describe... | The **actual code** builds... |
|---|---|---|
| Level size | 1920 px wide, **3 zones** | 960 px wide, **1 zone** |
| Cherries (collectibles) | **20 cherries** | **zero — not built** |
| Gaps / hazards | 4 gaps, 2 hazards | 2 gaps (64px + 48px), 1 spike |
| Status | *proposed, not approved* | *built + machine-tested* |

The big design docs (`GDD.md`, `LEVEL-DESIGN.md`, `GAME-BRIEF.md`) are a
**plan / wishlist** for a fuller game. `DESIGN-STATUS.json` confirms it: every
feature is marked `"implemented": false` — only the small "First Steps" slice
is real.

**Rule of thumb: trust the CODE for current behavior. Treat the big `.md`
files as "someday" plans, not descriptions of what runs.** Do not go hunting
for cherry code — it does not exist yet.

---

## 3. The code that actually matters (only ~6 files)

Everything runs from `godot/`. The game is built almost entirely **in code** —
there is barely any visual scene to click around in.

| File | What it does | Edit it when... |
|---|---|---|
| `game/main.tscn` | Nearly empty entry point. Just attaches `session.gd`. | (rarely) |
| `game/session.gd` | **The brain.** Reads the level JSON, builds every platform/spike/flag, spawns player + camera + HUD, runs the game states, handles input, draws the level. ~200 lines. | most changes |
| `features/player/player.gd` | The player: movement, jumping, gravity, self-drawing. | changing how the player moves |
| `features/player/tuning.gd` | Just **numbers** (speed, jump strength, gravity, forgiveness windows). | changing how the jump *feels* — easiest safe edit |
| `ui/hud.gd` | The on-screen text, progress bar, menus. | changing UI text/layout |
| `levels/first_steps.json` | The **level layout as data** (floor pieces, gap, spike, flag positions). | reshaping the level without touching code |

**Where your changes will most likely go:** `session.gd`, `first_steps.json`
(level shape), or `tuning.gd` (feel).

---

## 4. How it works under the hood (the flow)

1. Godot loads `main.tscn`, which runs `session.gd`.
2. `session.gd._ready()` reads `levels/first_steps.json` and **builds the whole
   level in code** — every floor, wall, spike, and the goal become physics
   bodies created at runtime. It also spawns the player, a camera, and the HUD.
3. A **state machine** drives everything (see `enum State`):
   `MENU → PLAYING → (DYING → auto-respawn) → COMPLETE`.
4. Each physics frame, `session.gd` checks: did the player fall too far, touch a
   spike, or reach the goal? and reacts (die + respawn, or finish).
5. `player.gd` handles input → velocity → `move_and_slide()` every physics tick.

**Physics layers** (from `project.godot`): World = layer 1, Player = layer 2,
Hazard = layer 4, Goal = layer 5.

---

## 5. Two design details worth knowing

- **No art files.** The player, spikes, flag, and platforms are all *drawn in
  code* with `draw_rect()` and `draw_colored_polygon()`. There are no sprite
  images to manage — visuals live inside `_draw()` functions.
- **The jump feels forgiving on purpose.** Two tricks in `player.gd` +
  `tuning.gd`:
  - **Coyote time** (`coyote_ticks = 6`): you can still jump for ~6 frames
    *after* walking off a ledge — like a cartoon character hanging in the air
    a beat before falling.
  - **Jump buffering** (`buffer_ticks = 6`): if you tap jump slightly *before*
    landing, it still fires when you touch down.
  - These are standard platformer polish — why good platformers feel smooth
    instead of unfair.

### Current tuning values (`features/player/tuning.gd`)
```
speed             = 160.0
acceleration      = 1280.0
deceleration      = 1920.0
jump_velocity     = -320.0   (negative = up)
gravity           = 960.0
terminal_velocity = 480.0
coyote_ticks      = 6
buffer_ticks      = 6
```

---

## 6. The level data (`levels/first_steps.json`)

The level is pure data — reshaping it needs no code changes. Format for solids
is `[x, y, width, height]`, origin top-left, Y increases downward.

- `width: 960`, `fall_y: 430` (fall below this = death), `spawn: [64, 320]`
- **Floors (3 pieces, leaving 2 gaps):**
  - `[0, 320, 448, 64]` → ends at x=448
  - `[512, 320, 224, 64]` → starts at 512 ⇒ **64px gap** (448–512)
  - `[784, 320, 176, 64]` → starts at 784 ⇒ **48px gap** (736–784)
- **Steps:** `[160, 304, 48, 16]` (16px step), `[576, 288, 48, 32]` (32px step)
- **Hazard (spike):** `[320, 304, 24, 16]` (three-spike cluster)
- **Finish flag:** `[916, 264, 24, 56]`

---

## 7. Tests already exist (`godot/tests/`)

Automated checks prove the mechanics work — useful for confirming you didn't
break anything.

- `test_game.gd` — ~34 mechanics checks (movement, jump height, coyote/buffer
  windows, spike death, respawn, 20 consecutive retries, a full winning route).
- `test_keyboard.gd` — 9 checks that inject real key events (start, move, jump,
  pause, resume, retry, replay, menu).
- `route_driver.gd` — a known winning path: jump at x = **138, 292, 424, 548,
  712**.

**Run the tests (headless) from the repo root:**
```bash
godot --headless --path godot --script res://tests/test_game.gd
godot --headless --path godot --script res://tests/test_keyboard.gd
```
Exit code 0 = all passed. Results are written to the `evidence/` folder.

## 8. My git workflow for this assignment

Goal: keep **main** clean; all changes land via reviewed pull requests.

1. This is my **fork**: `github.com/pulapartys/walker-jumpman-joe`
   (forked from `nikbearbrown/walker-jumpman`). I push to my fork, never the
   original.
2. Work on a **feature branch** (e.g. `joe-dev`), never directly on `main`.
3. Push branch → open a **Pull Request** on GitHub → review → merge to main.
4. **Branch protection rule** on `main`: "Require a pull request before
   merging" is ON. (Do NOT turn on "Require approvals" — solo repo, it would
   lock me out.)

Everyday loop:
```
edit on my branch → commit → push → open PR → review → merge to main
```

---

## 9. Doc reading order (from the README)

1. `GAME-BRIEF.md` — short player-facing idea + proposed scope
2. `GDD.md` — full design doc (big; mostly aspirational)
3. `LEVEL-DESIGN.md` — the proposed 3-zone course (untested)
4. `PRODUCTION-PLAN.md` — 22 planned tasks across 6 phases
5. `PLAYTEST-PLAN.md` — testing protocol
6. `ASSET-PLAN.md` — art/placeholder plan
7. `DESIGN-STATUS.json` — machine-readable truth about what's done

`BUILD-REPORT.md` = the honest record of what the "First Steps" slice actually
implements and tested. Read this one to know reality.

# Assignment 1 Specifications

> Verbatim requirements from the assignment brief, reorganized for reference.
> Requirements only — no added interpretation.

## Overview

- **Title:** Assignment 1 - Extend Walker Jumpman
- **Course:** CSYE 7270 · Fall 2026
- **Points:** 100
- **Cadence:** Assignments follow a 10-day cadence. Use this assignment's due
  date in Canvas. The syllabus's 10% daily late penalty applies.
- **Required viewing:** AI Policy for Professor Bear's Courses | Using AI
  Responsibly in Class (external link).

## Your task

- Start with walker-jumpman.
- Give its main character a new visual identity and extend its actual playable
  level.
- Preserve the basic control/retry experience, test your changes, and explain
  the result in a rendered film using Brutalist's Godot workflow.
- This is an extension of the starter, not a new game built from an empty
  project.
- Credit the starter and identify your additions.
- Your project name must begin with `walker-`, for example
  `walker-jumpman-maya-k`.
- Do your work in your own copy or course-authorized repository, not directly in
  the instructor's source repository.
- Claude Code assistance is expected. Use your Northeastern access; no purchased
  API credits or paid asset-generation service is required.
- You remain responsible for the implementation and must be able to explain the
  code, design decisions, tests, and film.

## 1. Predict — write `CHANGE-BRIEF.md` before implementation

Write a short change brief in `CHANGE-BRIEF.md`:

- Your character concept and the visual features that will distinguish it from
  the starter.
- The new section of level and the decisions it asks the player to make.
- What must remain unchanged: controls, movement/jump tuning, collision
  behavior, retry, pause, and completion, unless you explicitly justify a
  necessary change.
- At least two predicted failure cases and how you will check them.
- Retain the original predictions. Add later revisions rather than rewriting the
  record to make every prediction look correct.

## 2. Build It

### Replace the main character's visual identity

- Create a recognizable character concept with a meaningful change in shape,
  silhouette, or visible features — not only a name or color change.
- Original geometric drawing is sufficient. Imported art is optional; you must
  document its source and permission to use it.
- The starter draws its character in `godot/features/player/player.gd`; it does
  not use an existing sprite sheet. Inspect `_draw()` before choosing your
  approach.
- Preserve the movement parameters and collider for the initial visual change.
- Make the new appearance read sensibly against the collision boundary,
  including while facing left and right and while jumping.
- Explain any necessary departure from the original collider or behavior and
  test it explicitly.

### Extend the actual playable level

- Add a new playable section beyond the starter route with at least two new
  landings that require jumps.
- The extension must add a clear player decision or challenge, not merely
  stretch an empty floor.
- Move the finish so the player must complete the new section to win.
- Retain a usable route through the original section and preserve failure/retry
  behavior.
- Inspect `godot/levels/first_steps.json` and the code that reads and draws it
  in `godot/game/session.gd`.
- A wider level may require camera, bounds, background, labels, and
  finish-marker changes.
- In this starter, some drawing coordinates are hard-coded: moving data alone
  does not guarantee that a hazard or label will be drawn in the correct place.
  Keep what the player sees consistent with what the physics checks.
- Do not change jump strength or remove collision checks simply to make an
  impossible extension pass. Revise the geometry first.
- Keep the scope small enough to inspect and complete in this assignment window.
  Multiplayer, new game engines, paid assets, and a standalone exported
  application are not required.

### Work in inspectable increments

- Ask Claude to propose a plan before editing, then implement one bounded change
  at a time. Example prompt:

  > Read this project's README, build report, and my CHANGE-BRIEF.md.
  > Use Walker's brief → build → playtest → inspect → revise workflow.
  > First locate the character drawing and collider, level data, drawing code,
  > camera bounds, finish logic, and relevant tests. Propose the smallest plan
  > for my character replacement and level extension. Do not edit yet.
  > After I approve a step, implement only that step, show the diff, run the
  > relevant checks, and tell me what still requires human playtesting.

- This is a prompt to Claude Code, not an installed shell command. You decide
  whether to accept the plan.

## 3. Use It

- Play the modified game yourself using normal controls.
- Record the actual result of each check in `TEST-REPORT.md`, with the source
  revision and engine version:

| Check | Evidence to collect |
|---|---|
| Startup and controls | Project runs; movement, jump, pause/resume, and restart still work. |
| Character appearance | Left/right, standing, and jumping views; no misleading visual/collision mismatch. |
| Extended route | A normal playable route reaches both new landings and the relocated finish. |
| Failure and recovery | A real hazard or missed landing produces the expected retry; replay works after completion. |
| Camera and presentation | The extension and important landing/finish information remain visible and readable. |
| Automated checks | Commands, results, and any failed or updated tests, with an explanation. |

- Ask Claude to run the existing mechanics and keyboard checks where available.
- Preserve the earlier results.
- The supplied route fixture was authored for the original layout; extending the
  level may require an updated route test. Explain what changed in the fixture
  and add a check for the extension.
- Do not delete a failing assertion or weaken an expected result merely to
  obtain a green report.
- Include at least one documented inspect-and-revise cycle based on an
  observation. It may address clarity or usability even if no crash occurs.
- If you can have another person play, record their actual feedback; do not
  invent a playtester. Your own playtest is required, and an automated input
  route does not replace it.

## 4. Ship It — source and explainer

### Make one required Brutalist Godot explainer

- Use the course-provided Brutalist godot-walkthrough workflow with the walker
  modifier. The original skill spelling is `godot-waikthrough`.
- Ask Claude Code to read the installed skill instructions and follow them; do
  not assume the skill name is a standalone executable.
- If your checkout lacks the skill, request the course-provided version before
  proceeding.
- Make one landscape film that:
  - Identifies the starter, your character concept, and your level extension.
  - Shows the actual modified game being played, including the new landings, a
    failure/recovery, and completion.
  - Explains at least one cause-and-effect connection between a source change and
    the behavior on screen.
  - States what you tested, what remains uncertain, and one concrete next
    improvement.
  - Identifies human and AI contributions and the game revision being
    demonstrated.
- Use the Walker opening/summary and Verdict → Your Turn → regular outro.
- AI narration, including Liam, is allowed.
- Label reconstructed interface views, scripted-input captures, and held frames
  accurately.
- Preserve actual gameplay evidence; do not fake a completion or change the game
  solely to conceal a defect in the film.
- Follow the skill's native 4K landscape rendering and quality checks, then
  watch the final export.
- Keep important details readable and narration intelligible.
- Duration should follow the explanation; there is no minimum runtime to fill.
- A second film, a vertical Short, paid media generation, and public YouTube
  publication are not required.
- The film is part of the 60-point implementation-and-explanation category
  below. It is not a fifth grading category and does not substitute for working
  source.

### Post the version on GitHub

Your submitted source includes:

- The modified Godot project and any permitted source assets; exclude generated
  caches and credentials.
- `README.md`: project name, starter credit, engine version, run instructions,
  controls, changes, known limitations, and final-film link.
- `CHANGE-BRIEF.md`, `TEST-REPORT.md`, `FRICTIONAL.md`, and `SOURCES.md`.
- The film's beat sheet, script/prompts, and relevant evidence/coverage records.

Additional posting requirements:

- Keep MP3, MP4, and files over 25 MB out of GitHub. Store them in the
  designated course media storage and link them from the README.
- Identify the exact film by filename and SHA-256 checksum so its version can be
  checked.
- Test reviewer access to the source and media.
- Use commit messages that describe a meaningful change and its purpose or
  check. For example: `Extend final landing; update route test and verify
  retry.`
- When useful, add a commit-body note distinguishing your decision from Claude's
  implementation.
- Commit count is not a measure of learning.

## 5. Verify and submit to Canvas

- Run the project from a fresh copy of the revision you are submitting.
- Confirm that required assets are present and that the film depicts that game
  source.
- Do not treat a working local folder as proof that everything was posted.
- Submit a source ZIP of that same GitHub revision, excluding caches,
  credentials, and large media, together with a short `SUBMISSION.md` or
  equivalent submission note containing:
  - Assignment: Assignment 1 - Extend Walker Jumpman
  - Student:
  - Project name:
  - GitHub repository/folder URL:
  - Submitted commit SHA:
  - Game-source revision shown in the film:
  - Godot version and operating system:
  - Final film URL and filename:
  - Final film SHA-256:
  - Summary of my changes:
  - Known limitations:
- It is fine to render from a game-source commit and then make a final
  submission commit adding the film documentation. Identify both revisions and
  verify that the final commit does not change the demonstrated game source.
- Put the final submitted SHA in the Canvas note; do not try to embed a commit's
  own SHA into that same commit.
- Canvas, GitHub, and the film must refer to the same submitted work. Identify
  later changes as a new revision rather than silently replacing the submitted
  evidence.

## Rubric — 100 points

| Component | Points |
|---|---|
| Implementation and explanation | 60 |
| Frictional — honest log | 10 |
| GitHub version posting matching Canvas | 10 |
| Relative Quartile | 20 |
| **Total** | **100** |

### Implementation and explanation — 60 points

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---|
| Character: distinct visual identity (8); readable states and sensible visual/collision alignment with preserved or justified behavior (7). | 15 |
| Level: two new jump landings and a meaningful extension (12); reachable relocated finish and consistent camera/bounds/visuals (8). | 20 |
| Verification: documented baseline and automated/regression checks (5); actual human playtest of route, failure/recovery, and replay (5); evidence-based revision and an honest limitation (5). | 15 |
| Brutalist explainer: accurate explanation of your changes (4); actual mechanism/gameplay shown (3); traceable evidence and stated limits (2); readable, audible final film using the required workflow (1). | 10 |
| **Subtotal** | **60** |

- Award partial credit for demonstrated work within each criterion. Claims must
  be defensible; attractive presentation does not repair an incorrect
  explanation.

### Frictional — honest log — 10 points

In `FRICTIONAL.md`, record actual attempts, expectations, difficulties or
checks, responses, and learning. Distinguish your work from the AI's work.

- **3 points:** Specific, honest accounts of what you tried and what happened.
- **3 points:** What you checked, changed, or learned in response, including
  unresolved questions.
- **2 points:** Explicit human/AI contributions, including what you accepted,
  modified, or rejected.
- **2 points:** Traceability to relevant commits, prompts, tests, or
  observations.

An unsuccessful attempt can earn full Frictional credit. More hours, more
entries, or invented struggle do not earn extra credit. If something worked
immediately, say so and explain how you checked it. Label retrospective notes
honestly. AI may organize your notes; it must not manufacture experience or
understanding.

### GitHub version posting matching Canvas — 10 points

- **4 points:** Required, accessible game source and documentation are actually
  posted.
- **3 points:** Canvas identifies the exact submitted commit and supplies the
  matching source files and clear run instructions.
- **3 points:** Accessible film link, identified media version, and film
  source/evidence correspond to the submitted game.

### Relative Quartile — 20 points

- Assigned after the instructor and TAs review the full comparison group.
- It compares specificity, substantive improvement, demonstrated understanding,
  evidence, honesty about verification, usability, and professional
  communication. These are comparative considerations, not extra point
  categories.
- Meeting the stated criteria can earn the other 80 points; it does not
  guarantee these 20 points.
- The course's announced comparison-group and tie/late-work rules govern
  placement.
- Production polish matters only as professional communication. A plain, precise
  explanation outranks a beautiful one that misrepresents the work.
- Paid-tool access and simply using Brutalist earn no automatic comparative
  bonus.

## You must be able to explain it

- Use `SOURCES.md` to credit the starter, assets, collaborators, and tools.
- Describe what AI contributed to the game, script, beat sheet, visuals, and
  narration, along with what you personally decided, checked, changed, or
  rejected.
- The instructor or a TA may ask you to explain any part of your submission.
  Inability to explain reduces points under the relevant criteria.
- Misrepresenting authorship or verification is an academic-integrity matter
  under the course AI policy video and the course/university policies.

## Required deliverables (files named in the spec)

- `README.md` (updated)
- `CHANGE-BRIEF.md`
- `TEST-REPORT.md`
- `FRICTIONAL.md`
- `SOURCES.md`
- `SUBMISSION.md` (or equivalent submission note)
- The film's beat sheet, script/prompts, and evidence/coverage records
- The final film (stored in course media storage, not GitHub; linked from
  README with filename + SHA-256)
- Source ZIP of the submitted GitHub revision (excluding caches, credentials,
  large media)
